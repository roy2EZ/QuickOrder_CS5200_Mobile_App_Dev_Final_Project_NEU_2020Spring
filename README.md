# QuickerOrder

## App description
It is an application where the users can order dishes by themselves in a restaurant, and ask for related service in the app. We try to add some small functions with a little bit of interaction and fun for our users, and also utilize more sensors and features of Android phones to apply what we learn from this class.  
## Features

- HOUSE SPECIAL menu which provides a specific recommendation dish to the customer.
- ADD TO CART page for a dish, with interesting gesture drawing features:
  - Draw a “O” to add 1 order of the dish to the cart. 
  - Draw a “X” to remove 1 order of the dish from the cart.
